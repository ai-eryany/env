# Minimalist Fullstack Environment Setup 💻✨

Welcome to my streamlined fullstack environment! If you enjoy working efficiently with clean code and minimal distractions, this setup is right for you. Built for speed and maintainability, it’s a reflection of my minimalist approach to software development.

## 🧩 Key Components

- **Editor:** VS Code 🖋
- **Theme:** Dark Modern (default, because I hate having options)
- **Shell:** Git Bash integrated into VS Code 🚀
- **Vim Mode:** Because real developers never leave their keyboards 🔥
  
### 🚀 Extensions
1. **Advanced New File** – Quicker file creation without the clunky file explorer.
2. **File Bunny** – Organize like a pro, files at your command.
3. **Prettier** – For code that’s not just functional but beautiful.
4. **ESLint** – Because linting is essential, not optional. (Only for TS/JS)
5. **Vim** – Modal editing for the win!

### ⚙️ VS Code Settings
Here’s how I keep my workspace sleek:

#### Font Configuration
- **Font Family:** `Monoid Nerd Font` for everything (editor, terminal, debug console—you name it).
- **Font Size:** 13px — perfect for focused coding.
- **Font Weight:** 500 — just enough weight to feel solid without overwhelming your eyeballs.

#### Editor & Layout
- **Relative Line Numbers** – To keep me in the flow.
- **No Minimap, No Folding** – I keep distractions to a minimum.
- **Terminal Default Profile:** Git Bash 💻
- **Activity Bar:** Moved to the top, because why not?

#### Search and Fuzzy Matching
- **No Explorer Use!** Everything is quick-search based for ultimate speed.
- **Excludes:** No distractions from `dist` or `node_modules`.

#### Git
- **Auto-fetch** – Never fall behind on those upstream changes again.
- **Open repositories in parent folders** – Always stay organized.

### 🗝️ Keybindings
Minimal remapping for fast navigation (With Vim compatibility):
- `Ctrl+N` / `Ctrl+P`: Navigate through quick-open like a ninja.
- `Ctrl+F`: Opens my search, right where it should be.
- `Ctrl+P`: Opens command pallete.
- `Ctrl+Shift+B`: Ever heard of tasks in Vscode? (Forget Vim or the terminal with this)
- **Vim integration:** Remapped `/` for searching in Normal mode.
- **Removed some built-in keybindings**


### ⚙️ Starship config (starship.toml)
Minimal and beautiful prompt config for the starship terminal, starship makes git bash looks better
and feels better.
 

### 🌟 Why This Setup?

If you're into keeping things simple, this environment was crafted to avoid bloat while maintaining high productivity. It’s all about stripping away the unnecessary and focusing on what matters: fast, clean, and maintainable code.
**(In short: Vim sucks, Vim motions don't)**
